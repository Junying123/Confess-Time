NEW VERSION 1.2

- Now Confession Post is now saved inside a tree data structure instead of using both Tree and DoublyLinkedList because it's easier and iteration use much less complicated codes. Maybe avoid wasting unused data.
- Doubly Linked List is used when viewing the posts. So that can iterate forward and backward.
- Generic Stack and Generic Queue are used to fix a bug(when going up a post in a tree(checking the parent node) after going down from a parent node, the program didn't remember the which parent is in the current iteration just before going down from a parent node).

#Renamed class
TreeNode.java     ---> ReplyNode.java
TreeNodeIter.java ---> ReplyNodeIter.java

VERSION 1.1

# Under PostNode.java (new class added v1.1)
- Uses Linked list data structure to create a list of confession post.
- Used under Iteration.java to simulate iteration of the linked-list with the iteration of the tree.
- TLDR: just want to see if the program can work or not when combining the use of linked-list and tree - guess what? it kinda works!

# Under Iteration.java (updated v1.1)
Added new methods:
getSet2() - new TreeNode object
showAllReplies() - print all replies under a post 
showOnlyRepliesTo() - print the only replies to a post given the post id

PostNode<TreeNode> post = new PostNode<>();             //Create a node for a post where the post is a root to a tree root
          TreeNode<ConfessionPost> root1 = getSet1();   //Create a parent/root node(post) that has all the children node(replies) 
          post.add(root1);                              //add the root node to the post node, where it can create a list of node/post(linked-list)
